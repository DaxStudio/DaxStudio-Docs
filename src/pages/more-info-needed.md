title: More Information Needed
---

**We would love to fix the crash you just experienced, but we need your help!**

We have had a similar crash reports submitted, but unfortunately we have been unable to reproduce this crash.

If you know a series of steps that can trigger this issue could you please help us by telling us how this crash can be reproduced?

You can do this in either of the following ways:
1. (preferred) you could raise an [issue on Github](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/new) and post the reproduction steps there. This does require a GitHub login, but will let us have a discussion if required in the comments. _or_  
2. trigger the crash again and type the steps to reproduce the issue into the crash report dialog. This will let you log the steps anonymously (unless you choose to add your email address). 
> _However if we don't have a way of contacting you it does mean we can't ask for clarification if we have any problems with the reproduction steps._
