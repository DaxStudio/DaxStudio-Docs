## The issue that just caused DAX Studio to crash has already been fixed

You are running an older version of DAX Studio, updating to the latest version by downloading and installing it from our [homepage](https://daxstudio.org) should fix this issue.

However if the problem re-occurs please consider logging a bug [here](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/new) 

> Sometimes the automatic crash reporting does not provide enough information for us to properly identify and fix and issue and we need more information about the steps leading up to a crash
