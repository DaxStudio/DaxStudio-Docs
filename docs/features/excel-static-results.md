title: Excel - Static Results
---
> This output option is only available when DAX Studio is launched from the Excel Addin

This output option simply executes the DAX query and copies the results into the specified sheet in the active Excel worksheet. This is just a static copy of the data which cannot be refreshed. (unlike the [Linked Excel](../excel-linked-results) output option)
