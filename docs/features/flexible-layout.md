title: Flexible Layout
---

Dax Studio incorporates a docking control which allows you to move documents and tool windows around to suit your personal taste. 

Tool Windows can be positioned within a document:

If you desired, the results can be positioned somewhere other than the default position under the edit pane

And Documents can be positioned within the main window:

_**Note:** currently layout changes cannot be saved, we hope to add this feature in a future release_
