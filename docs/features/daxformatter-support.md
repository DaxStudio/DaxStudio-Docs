Dax Studio has built-in support for formatting queries using www.daxformatter.com (so you must have an internet connection in order to format a query)

For example if you typed the following query:
![](dax_formatter_before.png)

Clicking on the Dax Formatter button (or pressing F6) will format your query
![](dax_formatter_after.png)
