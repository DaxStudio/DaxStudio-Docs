Tabular Analysis Services models and PowerPivot models have the ability to be queried from multi-dimensional and tabular clients. This feature displays the metadata in a Tabular format and when you double-click or drag items off the metadata pane onto the query pane you will get the tabular name format. 

As of version 2 Hierarchies and KPIs are supported. In tabular terms a hierarchy is basically a collection of levels and a KPI is a container which holds 3 different measures (one each for Actual, Target and Status) there are no special DAX functions for dealing with hierarchies and KPIs.
