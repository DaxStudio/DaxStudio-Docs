### Run Query
This is the default mode. It will execute the selected query and sent the results to the selected [output](output-modes)

### Clear Cache and Run
In this mode before the query is run a clear cache command is sent to make sure that the query runs on a cold cache. This is most often used when performance tuning and saves having to remember to manually click the Clear Cache button before running a query
