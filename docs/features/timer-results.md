## Timer Results
This mode is meant for use in performance tuning when you want to run different variations of a query, but are not interested in viewing the results. You can use this output target in conjunction with the [Server Timings](/docs/features/traces/server-timings-trace) or [Query Plan](/docs/features/traces/query-plan-trace) traces.
