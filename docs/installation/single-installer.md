title: Universal Installer

As of version 2 there is now a single integrated installer which caters for both 32 and 64 bit installs and for both Excel 2010, 2013 & 2016. It will also download and install any missing prerequisites.

Prerequisites (the installer will attempt to download these if they are not present):
- .Net Framework 4.7.1 ( [web installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56115) &#x7c; [offline installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116) )



## Manually Installing Dependencies
The links to the dependencies are listed above. If you don't have access to the internet on the machine where you wish to install DAX Studio and this machine does not have .Net 4.7.1 or later you should download the offline installer which is a larger download, but does not require an internet connection during the install.
