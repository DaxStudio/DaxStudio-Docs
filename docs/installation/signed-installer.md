title: Signed Installer
---

As of v2.12 the DAX Studio installer is now signed with an [Extended Validation (EV) Certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate) 

The fact that Installer now signed with an EV certificate should hopefully prevent all the issues and warnings coming from Windows [SmartScreen](smart-screen) when attempting to download and install DAX Studio.

A **HUGE** thank-you goes out to the guys at [SQLBI.com](https://sqlbi.com). To acquire an EV certificate not only requires a financial outlay, but you also need to have a legal company entity with a physical office with financial records and things like that. Both of these things make it pretty much impossible for a free/open source tool to obtain an EV certificate on their own without assistance.

:::info
Even though Windows may show **SQLBI** as the publisher this is just because they have funded the code signing certificate and it is a condition of the EV certificate that it has to bear the legal name of the entity that purchased it. **DAX Studio** is still an open source tool and all support requests still go through our [github issue register](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues).
