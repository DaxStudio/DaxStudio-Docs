# DAX Studio version 3.3.2

## Updates
* Added option to show whitespace and control characters in editor
* Added SQL and TabularQuery filter buttons to Server Timings
* Added the [accesstoken](/docs/features/command-line/commands/accesstoken-command) command to dscmd
* Right-click define measures / define dependent measures works when a query is selected and just defines the measures referenced in that query

If you select an entire query and choose the option to **Define measures** or **Define dependent measures**
![](./query_define_measures_start.png)

DAX Studio will then inject all the measures reference in the query

![](./query_define_measures_result.png)

you can see that: 
1. the measure that is referenced directly in the query has been defined
2. the dependent measure has also been defined
