# DAX Studio version 3.0.6

Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3.0.6 of DAX Studio

## Updated Timeline/Waterfall visualization in Server Timings
The old Waterfall column has been replaced by the new Timeline column. This column contains the same information as the old waterfall column, but includes a new background image to help visualise times during the execution of a query when either the formula engine (denoted by yellow sections) or the storage engine (denoted by blue sections) was active.

Below is an annotated example of the new **Timeline** column.

![new timeline chart](timeline.png)
1. You can see at the start of this query that there is a block of yellow Formula Engine work taking place
1. Then each of the Storage Engine scans are represented by a thicker blue rectangle
1. Any batch events are represented by a lighter blue rectangle. You can see in this example that 3 preceeding scans are part of the batch
1. Finally we can see that the query has a block of Formula engine work at the end of the query

:::info
Note that the time that is allocated to the Formula Engine (denoted by the yellow portions of the Timeline) are simply those times during the query when no Storage Engine events were taking place. We do not have separate events for the formula engine activity.

## xmSQL / DirectQuery formatting improvements
The formatting of the xmSQL code in the Server Timings pane has been improved to include key word highlighting and improved line breaks to make the code easier to read

## New output options
There are a number of improvements to the output options in this release of DAX Studio

### New .json file Output option
When outputting to a file you now have the option to output to a json format. This output produces the same format as the Power BI [ExecuteQueries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/execute-queries) REST API

### Custom CSV encoding
When using the custom csv format you can now choose between utf-8 or unicode encoding

### Formatted File output
There is now a "Formatted File" output option. The standard "File" output is the recommended one as it outputs your data with full precision, decimal numbers are output without any rounding and datetimes are output using a standard ISO 8601 format. However if you require a csv output which uses the same formatting that gets applied to the grid output then this new "Formatted File" option gives you that. Just be aware that if you are transferring these files between machines that you may have issues with datetime data if your regional settings are different between the machines.

## FE Benchmarks (Preview)

:::tip
This feature is not visible by default you need to turn it on in the Options - Preview settings
:::

The FE Benchmark feature runs a standard formula engine only query against the current data source. It produces a FE Benchmark number that should help in estimating the expected performance in production.

If your laptop runs a query in 2 seconds and it's index is 200, then if you run the same query on a server that has an index 100 we should expect roughly 4 seconds ie. the query will take twice as long since the benchmark score was half.

This option is currently in preview so that we can start testing this across a wider range of real world scenarios. There are a lot of other factors that can influence query performance such concurrent load, CPU cache size and type and the memory and memory bus speeds to name a few. So we may need to look at adjusting this as we gather more real information.
