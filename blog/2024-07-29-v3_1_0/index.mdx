# DAX Studio version 3.1.0

Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3.1.0 of DAX Studio which includes the following fix.

## Highlights

### DSCMD - DAX Studio command line utility
DAX Studio is now shipping with a new utility called `dscmd.exe` this tool is a command line utility so you can run a subset of common operations from a command line.
This means that you can schedule tasks or run them as part of automated build pipelines. [Learn more](/docs/features/command-line)

### Capture Diagnostics
This feature provides an easy way to capture Server Timings, Query Plan and Model Metrics with a single click. 
This works for a single query in the editor or you can run this over the current set of queries in an All Queries trace or from imported Power BI Performance data. 
If you are using the All Queries or Performance Data option only queries matching the filter conditions are captured so you can do things like only capture diagnostics
for queries that run longer than 100ms. [Learn More](/docs/features/capture-diagnostics)

### Database dialog
When connecting to a server with a lot of databases like a Power BI workspace / Fabric it can be frustrating to wait for the first database in the list to populate its metadata
 and then have to change to one of the other database and wait again for the metadata. Now if it detects multiple databases DAX Studio will display a list of them so that
  you can select the one you wish to connect to. The list is sorted alphabetically and has a search box to help quickly locate a specific semantic model [Learn more](/docs/features/database-dialog)

### EvaluateAndLog Trace
The EvaluateAndLog function in DAX provides a way to get visibility of intermediate result sets that are used when evaluating DAX expressions. These can be helpful in diagnosing logic issues.

### Execution Metrics added to Server Timings
