which includes the following new features and fixes.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New Features\\n### DSCMD - added support for connecting to open Power BI Desktop files \\n\\nWhen using [dscmd](/docs/features/command-line) it is now possible to specify a connection to a file that is open in desktop. \\n\\nIf the `--server` parameter ends in .pbix or .pbip then dscmd will scan the local machine for currently running instances using the same logic that the DAX Studio UI does and will connect to the model with the matching file name.\\n\\neg.\\n\\n`dscmd csv c:\\\\temp\\\\stores.csv --server \\"adventure works.pbix\\" --query \\"EVALUATE stores\\"`\\n\\n:::info\\nNote that dscmd cannot query a pbix/pbip file directly, the file needs to be already open in Power BI Desktop.\\n:::\\n\\n### Added support for High Contrast Windows themes\\n\\nDAX Studio now has support for High Contrast Windows themes. Prior to this version some parts of the application had support while others did not resulting in a crash relating to missing resources. We now have a separate theme that explicitly supports high contrast mode. \\n\\n![](high_contrast.png)\\n\\n### Added ObjectName to Server Timings\\n\\nThere is an option in the right-click menu on the Server Timings grid to turn on the display of the **Object Name** column. This column shows the main object that was referenced during a scan or DQ operation and can be useful for quickly seeing which scans reference a specific fact table.\\n\\n![](objectname.png)\\n\\n### Displaying query errors in the results pane\\n\\nFrom <Issue id=\\"1361\\"/>:  The results pane now has an improved error display with a number of user experience improvements.\\n\\n* Before this the results of any prior valid query were retained which could have lead to confusion\\n* Large error messages often scroll out of view in the log pane and can be difficult to navigate to\\n* There is a **Copy** button if you need the error text for use in a search engine or support ticket\\n* There is a **Goto Error** button which will position your cursor at the error location if one is mentioned in the error message\\n\\n![](results_error.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Line numbers to Server Timings query pane\\n\\nFrom <Issue id=\\"1358\\"/>. The Query text in the Server Timings window now has line numbers to make it easier to reference parts of the query when doing presentations or screenshares.\\n\\n![](xmsql_linenumbers.png)\\n\\n### Find/Replace in selection\\n\\nThere is a new toggle button in the [Find/Replace](/docs/features/find-replace/) window that allows the user to restrict the find and replace operations to a specific selection. When the selection mode is active the background of the selection is colored to show the scope that the find/replace operation is working inside. This scope can be cleared by toggling the button or by closing the find/replace dialog.\\n\\n![](find_in_selection.png)\\n\\n## Updates\\n* <Issue id=\\"1359\\"/> saving error message in Server Timings and allowing copying of error\\n* Improved EntraID auth in dscmd\\n* Improved responsiveness while refreshing metadata against slow sources\\n* Improved code folding logic\\n* Find/Replace - pressing Enter key will trigger find next\\n* Find/Replace - search while user types\\n* <Issue id=\\"1369\\"/> added tooltips to ServerTimings columns\\n* <Issue id=\\"1368\\"/> added right click copy / select all to vertipaq analyzer\\n* <Issue id=\\"1370\\"/> added tooltip to View As button\\n* Updated dependencies\\n* Updated .Net framework version to 4.7.2\\n* Improved Server Timings debug logging\\n* Improved trace startup timeout checks\\n* Improved reliability of Benchmarking and Capture Diagnostics\\n* Improved insertion logic when defining measures\\n* Improved backward compatibility when loading Server Timings\\n\\n## Fixes\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1332\\"/> Define Dependent Measure and Expand Measures not working reliably\\n* Fixed detection of FormatString property in results\\n* Fixed crash when launched from Excel but there is no active query window\\n* Improved handling of embedded line breaks in linked Excel output\\n* Fixed Server Timings timeline caching bug\\n* Removed duplicate Metadata Refreshed log messages\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1324\\"/> All queries threading bug\\n* Fixed race condition in Benchmarking\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1330\\"/> Improved Font zooming in editor\\n* Fixed bug setting query parameter values from XML \\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1336\\"/> trace start error when switching some connection types\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1331\\"/> prevent code completion display for numbers\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1323\\"/> adding support for `// Query` comments when pasting DQ queries\\n* Fixed opening daxx file from inside a zip file\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1356\\"/> crash when defining measures from editor\\n* Fixed loading of daxx files from readonly locations \\n* Fixed incorrect validation error in Query Builder when loading non-string filters\\n* Fixed Find/Replace not working in QueryBuilder Measure Editor\\n* Fixed down arrow selecting from the database dialog\\n* Fixed <Issue id=\\"1371\\"/> File-Exit not triggering save changes dialog"},{"id":"v3_2_1-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/v3_2_1-release","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-04-v3_2_1/index.mdx","title":"v3.2.1 Release","description":"Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3.2.1 of DAX Studio which includes the following new features and fixes.","date":"2024-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"daxstudio","permalink":"/blog/tags/daxstudio"}],"readingTime":1.57,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Gosbell","title":"Maintainer of DAX Studio","url":"https://github.com/dgosbell","imageURL":"https://github.com/dgosbell.png","key":"dgosbell","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"v3_2_1-release","title":"v3.2.1 Release","authors":["dgosbell"],"tags":["daxstudio"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"v3.3.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3_3_0-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"v3.2.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3_2_0-release"}},"content":"import Issue from \'@site/src/components/Github-Issue\';\\n\\n\\nToday we are happy to announce the release of version 3.2.1 of DAX Studio which includes the following new features and fixes.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## DSCMD - DAX Parameter Support \\nIf you want to run a DAX query from the command line which has a parameter in it you can now pass a value to be used by that parameter\\n\\nBoth the [CSV](/docs/features/command-line/commands/csv-command) and [XLSX](/docs/features/command-line/commands/xlsx-command) commmands both support passing parameters using the `-m, --parameter` option.\\n\\nIn the following example the query has 2 parameters **@myColor** and **@myCategory** which are passed in using 2 `-m` options\\n\\neg.\\n```\\ndscmd csv c:\\\\temp\\\\myquery.csv -s localhost\\\\tab19 -d \\"Adventure Works DW\\"  ^\\n  -m myColor=Red ^\\n  -m myCategory=Bikes ^\\n  -q \\"EVALUATE FILTER(\'product\', \'product[Color]=@myColor && \'product\'[Category]=@myCategory)\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Improved Jumplist Integration\\nThe Jumplist is a feature of Windows 10 & 11 where right clicking on a program in your task bar would show you recently opened files.\\n\\n![](./jumplist.png)\\n\\nPreviously this list was only populated when you double clicked on a file that was associated with DAX Studio in Windows Explorer.

[Learn More](/docs/features/capture-diagnostics)\\n\\n![](../../docs/features/capture-diagnostics-all-queries.png)\\n\\n### Database dialog\\nWhen connecting to a server with a lot of databases like a Power BI workspace / Fabric it can be frustrating to wait for the first database in the list to populate its metadata\\n and then have to change to one of the other database and wait again for the metadata. Now if it detects multiple databases DAX Studio will display a list of them so that\\n  you can select the one you wish to connect to. The list is sorted alphabetically and has a search box to help quickly locate a specific semantic model [Learn more](/docs/features/database-dialog)\\n\\n![](../../docs/features/database-dialog.png)\\n\\n### EvaluateAndLog Trace\\nThe EvaluateAndLog function in DAX provides a way to get visibility of intermediate result sets that are used when evaluating DAX expressions. These can be helpful in diagnosing logic issues.\\n[Learn more](/docs/features/traces/evaluateandlog-trace)\\n\\n![](../../docs/tutorials/eval-and-log-3.png)\\n\\n### Execution Metrics added to Server Timings\\nThe new ExecutionMetrics events are now visible in Server Timings if your data source is capable of emitting those events.

Studio\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Metadata loading improvements\\n\\nDAX Studio uses an asynchronous, lazy loading strategy to populate the metadata which has worked reasonably well over the years, but we occassionaly see some strange errors due about reader objects being already in use (such as those in issue <Issue id=\\"1076\\"/> ) or responses containing unexpected data. There are actually a number of small tweaks in the previous verion (3.0.6) which were meant to help avoid these issues, but there was also one minor improvement to the formatting of query results which made this worse.\\n\\nThis sort of issue was extremely hard to isolate because I rarely saw it myself and it was very hard to come up with consistent scenarios to reproduce the issue. And if you cannot reproduce an issue you can make changes, but you don\'t know if you\'ve fixed the problem or if you\'ve just been lucky. It turns out that with some help from some log files from users I was able to isolate and reproduce this issue and confirm that it was a multi-threading bug. \\n\\nStarting with this version we now internally use a separate connection object for metadata and running queries so this should prevent this issue entirely going forward.\\n\\n## Delete entries from the recent server list\\n\\nThis is a small quality of life improvement where you can now delete entries from the recent server list from the connection dialog itself. This list should be self-maintaining as new entries are added at the top and old one should fall off the bottom over time. But if you have entries that are no longer valid and you want to clean up this list you now have an easy way to remove them.\\n\\n![](delete_recent_servers.png)\\n\\n## Clearing the Log and Results panes\\n\\nThere are now right-click options on the **Log** and **Results** panes to allow you to clear them.\\n\\n![](clear_log_and_results.png)\\n\\n## [Preview] Exporting Server Timings text to separate files\\n\\nThis option will change the behaviour of the **export** button in the Server Timings tab so that instead of exporting a single json file with the trace data it will export a file for each Storage Engine query that contains the text of each query. This can be useful in scenarios where the enging generates a lot of queries and you want to use another tool like VS Code to quickly navigate between the different files and compare them.\\n\\n![](server_timings_export.png)\\n\\n\\n## All new Features & Fixes\\n_Below is the full list of all the new features and fixes._\\n\\n### Updates\\n* <Issue id=\\"1094\\"/> delete items from server list\\n* <Issue id=\\"491\\"/> Clear Log and Clear Results context menu options\\n* Added a preview option for exporting\\n\\n### Fixes\\n* <Issue id=\\"1092\\"/> fix for spelling mistake in installer option\\n* <Issue id=\\"1076\\"/> fix for xmlReader in use errors\\n* <Issue id=\\"1077\\"/> incorrect hash calculation\\n* <Issue id=\\"1080\\"/> fixed issue with line comments when using linked Excel output\\n* <Issue id=\\"1081\\"/> min/max not populating in tooltips for some DQ models\\n* <Issue id=\\"1083\\"/> fixed linked Excel output not working with AAD authentication\\n* <Issue id=\\"1084\\"/> fixed crash on ctrl+shift+c\\n* <Issue id=\\"851\\"/> fixed Object not set error in Query Builder\\n* Fixed an issue loading older versions of ServerTimings data\\n* Fixed issues relating to a couple of reported crashes"},{"id":"v3_0_6-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/v3_0_6-release","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-13-v3_0_6/index.mdx","title":"v3.0.6 Release","description":"Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3.0.6 of DAX Studio","date":"2023-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"daxstudio","permalink":"/blog/tags/daxstudio"}],"readingTime":4.97,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Gosbell","title":"Maintainer of DAX Studio","url":"https://github.com/dgosbell","imageURL":"https://github.com/dgosbell.png","key":"dgosbell","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"v3_0_6-release","title":"v3.0.6 Release","authors":["dgosbell"],"tags":["daxstudio"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"v3.0.7 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3_0_7-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"v3 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3-release"}},"content":"import Issue from \'@site/src/components/Github-Issue\';\\n\\n\\nToday we are happy to announce the release of version 3.0.6 of DAX Studio\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Updated Timeline/Waterfall visualization in Server Timings\\nThe old Waterfall column has been replaced by the new Timeline column. This column contains the same information as the old waterfall column, but includes a new background image to help visualise times during the execution of a query when either the formula engine (denoted by yellow sections) or the storage engine (denoted by blue sections) was active.\\n\\nBelow is an annotated example of the new **Timeline** column.\\n\\n![new timeline chart](timeline.png)\\n1. You can see at the start of this query that there is a block of yellow Formula Engine work taking place\\n1. Then each of the Storage Engine scans are represented by a thicker blue rectangle\\n1. Any batch events are represented by a lighter blue rectangle. You can see in this example that 3 preceeding scans are part of the batch\\n1. Finally we can see that the query has a block of Formula engine work at the end of the query\\n\\n:::info\\nNote that the time that is allocated to the Formula Engine (denoted by the yellow portions of the Timeline) are simply those times during the query when no Storage Engine events were taking place. We do not have separate events for the formula engine activity. \\n:::\\n\\n## xmSQL / DirectQuery formatting improvements\\nThe formatting of the xmSQL code in the Server Timings pane has been improved to include key word highlighting and improved line breaks to make the code easier to read\\n![updated xmSQL formatting](xmsql_formatting.png)\\n\\n## New output options\\nThere are a number of improvements to the output options in this release of DAX Studio\\n\\n### New .json file Output option\\nWhen outputting to a file you now have the option to output to a json format. This output produces the same format as the Power BI [ExecuteQueries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/execute-queries) REST API\\n![](results_to_json.png)\\n\\n### Custom CSV encoding\\nWhen using the custom csv format you can now choose between utf-8 or unicode encoding\\n![](custom_encoding.png)\\n\\n### Formatted File output\\nThere is now a \\"Formatted File\\" output option. The standard \\"File\\" output is the recommended one as it outputs your data with full precision, decimal numbers are output without any rounding and datetimes are output using a standard ISO 8601 format. However if you require a csv output which uses the same formatting that gets applied to the grid output then this new \\"Formatted File\\" option gives you that. Just be aware that if you are transferring these files between machines that you may have issues with datetime data if your regional settings are different between the machines.\\n\\n![](formatted_file_output.png)\\n\\n\\n## FE Benchmarks (Preview)\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis feature is not visible by default you need to turn it on in the Options - Preview settings\\n:::\\n\\nThe FE Benchmark feature runs a standard formula engine only query against the current data source. It produces a FE Benchmark number that should help in estimating the expected performance in production.\\n\\nIf your laptop runs a query in 2 seconds and it\'s index is 200, then if you run the same query on a server that has an index 100 we should expect roughly 4 seconds ie. the query will take twice as long since the benchmark score was half.\\n\\nThis option is currently in preview so that we can start testing this across a wider range of real world scenarios. There are a lot of other factors that can influence query performance such concurrent load, CPU cache size and type and the memory and memory bus speeds to name a few. So we may need to look at adjusting this as we gather more real information.\\n\\n![](fe_benchmark.png)\\n---\\n\\n## All new Features & Fixes\\n_Below is the full list of all the new features and fixes._\\n\\n### New Features\\n* <Issue id=\\"861\\"/> adding SHA256 hashes for downloads\\n* <Issue id=\\"866\\"/> added copy with/without headers option for query results\\n* <Issue id=\\"973\\"/> Added Duplicate option to tab right-click menu\\n* <Issue id=\\"1016\\"/> open a .dax file by dragging it onto DAX Studio\\n* <Issue id=\\"1031\\"/> adding encoding option for custom CSV output\\n* <Issue id=\\"1051\\"/> added Formatted File as an output option\\n* added json option when outputting to a file\\n* FE Benchmarks\\n* Updated Timeline/Waterfall visualization in Server Timings\\n* xmSQL / DirectQuery formatting improvements\\n* moved preview and vertipaq analyzer settings from the advanced to the standard options page\\n\\n### Fixes\\n* <Issue id=\\"1062\\"/> fix vertipaq analyzer showing &gt;unknown&lt; in summary pane for AAS / PBIP\\n* <Issue id=\\"1060\\"/> enabling Shift+Enter to be used as a custom hotkey\\n* <Issue id=\\"1052\\"/> disabled re-ordering of columns in vertipaq analyzer\\n* <Issue id=\\"1036\\"/> fix location of desktop shortcut file for Current User installs\\n* <Issue id=\\"1030\\"/> QueryBuilder measures missing table references when loading from file\\n* <Issue id=\\"1029\\"/> QueryBuilder IN filters not loading from file correctly\\n* <Issue id=\\"1026\\"/> improving VertiPaq Analyzer tooltips\\n* <Issue id=\\"1025\\"/> fixing spelling / capitalization errors\\n* <Issue id=\\"968\\"/> Tool Window incorrectly docking\\n* <Issue id=\\"967\\"/> permission error on non-admin install\\n* <Issue id=\\"979\\"/> improved color contrast in dark mode\\n* <Issue id=\\"994\\"/> adjusted measure icon position when vertical scrollbars are always displayed\\n* <Issue id=\\"997\\"/> adding support for measure filters in Query Builder\\n* <Issue id=\\"999\\"/> fixed display of columns with open parenthesis as first character\\n* <Issue id=\\"951\\"/> moved Swap Delimiters / Debug Commas to advanced\\n* fixed metadata display for multi-dimensional models\\n* skip showing crash dialog if app is shutting down\\n* Improved generation of Define Measure and Define Dependent Measures\\n* Fixed crash in BindableFocusBehaviour and AutomationPeer\\n* fixed cell alignment in View Metrics Columns screen\\n* Fixed crash on update flag click event\\n* Fixed crash when browsing for a folder during CSV data export\\n* improvements for FE duration calculation\\n* added default file name when exporting bim from vpax\\n* fixed the hidden table icon\\n* fixed Excel tracing \\n* fixed invalid button states after failed connection attempt"},{"id":"v3-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/v3-release","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-24-v3-released/index.md","title":"v3 Release","description":"Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3 of DAX Studio","date":"2022-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"daxstudio","permalink":"/blog/tags/daxstudio"}],"readingTime":3.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Gosbell","title":"Maintainer of DAX Studio","url":"https://github.com/dgosbell","imageURL":"https://github.com/dgosbell.png","key":"dgosbell","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"v3-release","title":"v3 Release","authors":["dgosbell"],"tags":["daxstudio"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"v3.0.6 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3_0_6-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3 of DAX Studio\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Dark Mode!\\n\\nThis has been an outstanding request for a long time and finally we are happy to announce that we now support Dark Mode!

This \\n\\n![](queryplan-child-operations.png)\\n\\n### All Queries\\n\\nThe All Queries trace can now be run in parallel with other trace types. You used to have to either stop other traces or run them in a different document, but now all the different traces can be run at the same time if you need to. \\n\\n:::info\\nJust take note that traces do add some extra load to the Tabular Engine, so it\'s a good idea to stop them when you have finished collecting the data you needed.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## View As\\n\\nA new **View As** option has been added in the **Advanced** tab to enable easy testing of RLS roles\\n![](viewas-button.png)\\n\\nThis enables for both testing the functionality of the selected role to make sure queries return the correctly filtered data and you can run Server Timings traces to measure the impact of these roles on your queries.\\n\\nWhen it is active the **View As** option shows a yellow information bar at the top of the query editor. You can exit out of the **View As** mode by clicking on the X in the right hand side of the information bar\\n\\n![](./viewas-results.png)\\n\\nTo make performance comparisons even easier a new option has been added to the Benchmark feature which is enabled when you start the benchmark while you have **View As** active.\\n\\n![](benchmark-rls.png)\\n\\nWhen you tick the option to do a second pass the benchmark results will include a second set of columns in the results for those passes where the RLS role was active\\n\\n![](benchmark-rls-results.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Other Updates / Fixes\\n\\nThe following lists other minor fixes and improvements that have been added since the previous release\\n\\n## Updates\\n* [#826](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/826) added PowerPivot model detection timeout in options\\n* Updating syntax highlighting to handle multi-line strings\\n* Added highlighting of cache nodes in physical query plans\\n* Improved state tracking for trace windows\\n* Prevented interleaving of clearcache with query execution\\n* Width of the connection dialog has been increased \\n\\n## Fixes\\n* Fixed [#764](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/764) error when running from cmd prompt\\n* Fixed [#799](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/799) error when opening querybuilder files from older versions\\n* Fixed [#812](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/812) using FIPS compliant hash\\n* Fixed [#816](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/816) database dropdown too small\\n* Fixed [#838](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/838) added support for custom datetime formats when exporting to xlsx\\n* Fixed [#841](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/841) allowed for loading of performance data where component information was missing"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-20-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the DAX Studio blog.","date":"2022-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"daxstudio","permalink":"/blog/tags/daxstudio"}],"readingTime":0.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Gosbell","title":"Maintainer of DAX Studio","url":"https://github.com/dgosbell","imageURL":"https://github.com/dgosbell.png","key":"dgosbell","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["dgosbell"],"tags":["daxstudio"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"v3 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3-release"}},"content":"Welcome to the DAX Studio blog.\\n\\nThis is an area where we will put content of interest to DAX Studio users\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e"}]}}')}}]);
