This column contains the same information as the old waterfall column, but includes a new background image to help visualise times during the execution of a query when either the formula engine (denoted by yellow sections) or the storage engine (denoted by blue sections) was active.\\n\\nBelow is an annotated example of the new **Timeline** column.\\n\\n![new timeline chart](timeline.png)\\n1. You can see at the start of this query that there is a block of yellow Formula Engine work taking place\\n1. Then each of the Storage Engine scans are represented by a thicker blue rectangle\\n1. Any batch events are represented by a lighter blue rectangle. You can see in this example that 3 preceeding scans are part of the batch\\n1. Finally we can see that the query has a block of Formula engine work at the end of the query\\n\\n:::info\\nNote that the time that is allocated to the Formula Engine (denoted by the yellow portions of the Timeline) are simply those times during the query when no Storage Engine events were taking place. We do not have separate events for the formula engine activity. \\n:::\\n\\n## xmSQL / DirectQuery formatting improvements\\nThe formatting of the xmSQL code in the Server Timings pane has been improved to include key word highlighting and improved line breaks to make the code easier to read\\n![updated xmSQL formatting](xmsql_formatting.png)\\n\\n## New output options\\nThere are a number of improvements to the output options in this release of DAX Studio\\n\\n### New .json file Output option\\nWhen outputting to a file you now have the option to output to a json format. This output produces the same format as the Power BI [ExecuteQueries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/execute-queries) REST API\\n![](results_to_json.png)\\n\\n### Custom CSV encoding\\nWhen using the custom csv format you can now choose between utf-8 or unicode encoding\\n![](custom_encoding.png)\\n\\n### Formatted File output\\nThere is now a \\"Formatted File\\" output option. The standard \\"File\\" output is the recommended one as it outputs your data with full precision, decimal numbers are output without any rounding and datetimes are output using a standard ISO 8601 format. However if you require a csv output which uses the same formatting that gets applied to the grid output then this new \\"Formatted File\\" option gives you that. Just be aware that if you are transferring these files between machines that you may have issues with datetime data if your regional settings are different between the machines.\\n\\n![](formatted_file_output.png)\\n\\n\\n## FE Benchmarks (Preview)\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis feature is not visible by default you need to turn it on in the Options - Preview settings\\n:::\\n\\nThe FE Benchmark feature runs a standard formula engine only query against the current data source. It produces a FE Benchmark number that should help in estimating the expected performance in production.\\n\\nIf your laptop runs a query in 2 seconds and it\'s index is 200, then if you run the same query on a server that has an index 100 we should expect roughly 4 seconds ie. the query will take twice as long since the benchmark score was half.\\n\\nThis option is currently in preview so that we can start testing this across a wider range of real world scenarios. There are a lot of other factors that can influence query performance such concurrent load, CPU cache size and type and the memory and memory bus speeds to name a few. So we may need to look at adjusting this as we gather more real information.\\n\\n![](fe_benchmark.png)\\n---\\n\\n## All new Features & Fixes\\n_Below is the full list of all the new features and fixes._\\n\\n### New Features\\n* <Issue id=\\"861\\"/> adding SHA256 hashes for downloads\\n* <Issue id=\\"866\\"/> added copy with/without headers option for query results\\n* <Issue id=\\"973\\"/> Added Duplicate option to tab right-click menu\\n* <Issue id=\\"1016\\"/> open a .dax file by dragging it onto DAX Studio\\n* <Issue id=\\"1031\\"/> adding encoding option for custom CSV output\\n* <Issue id=\\"1051\\"/> added Formatted File as an output option\\n* added json option when outputting to a file\\n* FE Benchmarks\\n* Updated Timeline/Waterfall visualization in Server Timings\\n* xmSQL / DirectQuery formatting improvements\\n* moved preview and vertipaq analyzer settings from the advanced to the standard options page\\n\\n### Fixes\\n* <Issue id=\\"1062\\"/> fix vertipaq analyzer showing &gt;unknown&lt; in summary pane for AAS / PBIP\\n* <Issue id=\\"1060\\"/> enabling Shift+Enter to be used as a custom hotkey\\n* <Issue id=\\"1052\\"/> disabled re-ordering of columns in vertipaq analyzer\\n* <Issue id=\\"1036\\"/> fix location of desktop shortcut file for Current User installs\\n* <Issue id=\\"1030\\"/> QueryBuilder measures missing table references when loading from file\\n* <Issue id=\\"1029\\"/> QueryBuilder IN filters not loading from file correctly\\n* <Issue id=\\"1026\\"/> improving VertiPaq Analyzer tooltips\\n* <Issue id=\\"1025\\"/> fixing spelling / capitalization errors\\n* <Issue id=\\"968\\"/> Tool Window incorrectly docking\\n* <Issue id=\\"967\\"/> permission error on non-admin install\\n* <Issue id=\\"979\\"/> improved color contrast in dark mode\\n* <Issue id=\\"994\\"/> adjusted measure icon position when vertical scrollbars are always displayed\\n* <Issue id=\\"997\\"/> adding support for measure filters in Query Builder\\n* <Issue id=\\"999\\"/> fixed display of columns with open parenthesis as first character\\n* <Issue id=\\"951\\"/> moved Swap Delimiters / Debug Commas to advanced\\n* fixed metadata display for multi-dimensional models\\n* skip showing crash dialog if app is shutting down\\n* Improved generation of Define Measure and Define Dependent Measures\\n* Fixed crash in BindableFocusBehaviour and AutomationPeer\\n* fixed cell alignment in View Metrics Columns screen\\n* Fixed crash on update flag click event\\n* Fixed crash when browsing for a folder during CSV data export\\n* improvements for FE duration calculation\\n* added default file name when exporting bim from vpax\\n* fixed the hidden table icon\\n* fixed Excel tracing \\n* fixed invalid button states after failed connection attempt"},{"id":"v3-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/v3-release","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-24-v3-released/index.md","title":"v3 Release","description":"Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3 of DAX Studio","date":"2022-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 24, 2022","tags":[{"label":"daxstudio","permalink":"/blog/tags/daxstudio"}],"readingTime":3.63,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Gosbell","title":"Maintainer of DAX Studio","url":"https://github.com/dgosbell","imageURL":"https://github.com/dgosbell.png","key":"dgosbell"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"v3-release","title":"v3 Release","authors":["dgosbell"],"tags":["daxstudio"]},"prevItem":{"title":"v3.0.6 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3_0_6-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"Today we are happy to announce the release of version 3 of DAX Studio\\n\\n## Dark Mode!\\n\\nThis has been an outstanding request for a long time and finally we are happy to announce that we now support Dark Mode! You can switch between the 3 different mode settings using the button at the top of the ribbon\\n\\n![](mode-button.png)\\n\\n* ![auto mode icon](auto-mode.png) Auto-detect - attempts to set the appropriate mode based off the preferences in the Operating System (should work for Windows 10 or higher)\\n* ![light mode icon](light-mode.png) Light mode\\n* ![dark mode icon](dark-mode.png) Dark mode\\n\\n## A clean, modern User Interface\\n\\nWith the help of the amazing Daniele at SQLBI we now have a clean, modern update to the user interface including new icons and visual styling\\n\\n![](modern-ui.png)\\n\\nA couple of important changes worth noting are:\\n* document tabs have been moved to the bottom\\n* Metadata, Functions and DMV tabs have been moved to the top of their area\\n* the tabs for Results, Logs, Traces have been move to the top of their area\\n\\n## New Ribbon options\\n\\nIn addition to being able to collapse the ribbon there is now also an option to show a simplified view\\n\\n![](ribbon-options.png)\\n\\nThis view takes up less vertical space while still keeping the most commonly used features easily accessible.\\n\\n![](simplified-ribbon.png)\\n\\n## Tracing Improvements\\n\\nThe internal tracing engine has been re-architected internally which will make it easier to add new trace types in future and it should also have fixed the issue where sometimes the trace data would \\n\\nIn addition the following enhancements have been made to the existing traces:\\n\\n### Server Timings - Waterfall column\\n\\nA \\"waterfall\\" column has now been added to the Server Timings tab. This gives you a quick visual indication of which Storage Engine queries took the longest and where they\\n\\n![](servertimings-waterfall.png)\\n\\n### Query Plan - child operation indicator\\n\\nThe Query Plan trace will now show a dashed line to indicate operations that are children of the currently selected row. This \\n\\n![](queryplan-child-operations.png)\\n\\n### All Queries\\n\\nThe All Queries trace can now be run in parallel with other trace types. You used to have to either stop other traces or run them in a different document, but now all the different traces can be run at the same time if you need to. \\n\\n:::info\\nJust take note that traces do add some extra load to the Tabular Engine, so it\'s a good idea to stop them when you have finished collecting the data you needed.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## View As\\n\\nA new **View As** option has been added in the **Advanced** tab to enable easy testing of RLS roles\\n![](viewas-button.png)\\n\\nThis enables for both testing the functionality of the selected role to make sure queries return the correctly filtered data and you can run Server Timings traces to measure the impact of these roles on your queries.\\n\\nWhen it is active the **View As** option shows a yellow information bar at the top of the query editor. You can exit out of the **View As** mode by clicking on the X in the right hand side of the information bar\\n\\n![](./viewas-results.png)\\n\\nTo make performance comparisons even easier a new option has been added to the Benchmark feature which is enabled when you start the benchmark while you have **View As** active.\\n\\n![](benchmark-rls.png)\\n\\nWhen you tick the option to do a second pass the benchmark results will include a second set of columns in the results for those passes where the RLS role was active\\n\\n![](benchmark-rls-results.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Other Updates / Fixes\\n\\nThe following lists other minor fixes and improvements that have been added since the previous release\\n\\n## Updates\\n* [#826](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/826) added PowerPivot model detection timeout in options\\n* Updating syntax highlighting to handle multi-line strings\\n* Added highlighting of cache nodes in physical query plans\\n* Improved state tracking for trace windows\\n* Prevented interleaving of clearcache with query execution\\n* Width of the connection dialog has been increased \\n\\n## Fixes\\n* Fixed [#764](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/764) error when running from cmd prompt\\n* Fixed [#799](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/799) error when opening querybuilder files from older versions\\n* Fixed [#812](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/812) using FIPS compliant hash\\n* Fixed [#816](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/816) database dropdown too small\\n* Fixed [#838](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/838) added support for custom datetime formats when exporting to xlsx\\n* Fixed [#841](https://github.com/daxstudio/daxstudio/issues/841) allowed for loading of performance data where component information was missing"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-20-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the DAX Studio blog.","date":"2022-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"daxstudio","permalink":"/blog/tags/daxstudio"}],"readingTime":0.105,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Gosbell","title":"Maintainer of DAX Studio","url":"https://github.com/dgosbell","imageURL":"https://github.com/dgosbell.png","key":"dgosbell"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["dgosbell"],"tags":["daxstudio"]},"prevItem":{"title":"v3 Release","permalink":"/blog/v3-release"}},"content":"Welcome to the DAX Studio blog.\\n\\nThis is an area where we will put content of interest to DAX Studio users"}]}')}}]);
